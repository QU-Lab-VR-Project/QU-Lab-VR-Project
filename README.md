## ðŸª„ Motivation

With more and more applications adopting and intergrating XR technology and due to insufficient computing power on the hardware side to support most of the unique content that XR can provide, shifting most of the computation to the network and handling information transfer across it instead of Head mounted devices (HDMs) or smartphones, arises as one of the most promising solutions.

### Goal -> Identify the limitations

## ðŸ“‚ In this Project

In this project you will find both scences we presented: the one for VR where the server can't be reached, and the one for unity where everything works perfectly. You can find both scences in Assets/Scenes and switch between them.
